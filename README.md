# Description
This is a fairly simple little application, mainly for novices just entering the world of C++. It is about a bank, in which you can deposit and withdraw money, you can see your balance, and you can exit the application. Very simple and easy to understand.

# Explaining the application

At the moment of executing the main binary (Which is obtained by executing the c++ code with g++), the console will be erased and a menu will appear, in which four options appear and a welcome to the bank, Enter money, Withdraw cash, Check balance and Exit; underneath appears a text that says "options: ", there we will write which option we want. (writing the number of the option we want).

If you write the number one, which means, Money Entry, you will enter money, so write the amount of money you want. After entering the money it will show how much money was entered and how much balance you have now.

The second option consists of withdrawing the money, and if the money you want to withdraw is less or equal to the money you have, you will be shown how much you have withdrawn and how much you have left.

On the contrary, if you want to withdraw an amount of money that you don't have (let's say you have $100 in the bank, and you want to withdraw $1000, you can't because you don't have that amount of money), you will be denied the withdrawal and the amount of money you actually have will be displayed.

# Conclusion

Although, the application can be improved a lot more and is quite simple, the objective is not to make it very complicated, nor to do anything very advanced; the objective is to show to the people that are just learning C++ programming, how a very small and simple application would be made in this same language. 

# Bye

Without further ado, I bid you farewell, have a nice day. Goodbye <3
