# Explanation of the code 

At the moment of executing the main binary (Which is obtained by executing the c++ code with g++), the console will be erased and a menu will appear, in which four options appear and a welcome to the bank, Enter money, Withdraw cash, Check balance and Exit; underneath appears a text that says "options: ", there we will write which option we want. (writing the number of the option we want).

If you write the number one, which means, Money Entry, you will enter money, so write the amount of money you want. After entering the money it will show how much money was entered and how much balance you have now.
